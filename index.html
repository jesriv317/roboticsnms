<H2>Introduction</H2>

<p>Everyone uses enormous amount of water every day. This is wasteful, especially in California . One person uses about 
100 gallons or more water per day. Droughts are common in the area too, so we need to conserve water. One idea is reusing
greywater. It is the water from baths, bathroom sinks, and washing machines that are safe for watering plants after filtering.
and used for toilet water.</p>

<H2>Toilet Water</H2>
<p>Toilet water is considered black water and when using it and you don't need to touch it. This is perfect to use greywater
on, especially because of how much water we use to flush it. Toilets use 7 to 1.6 gallons of water per flush! Overall,
it is an efficient system. The design will have a pipe from the shower drain to the toilet system.</p>

<H2>Greywater for Irrigation</H2>
<p>Greywater can have many substances in them. Some can be dangerous to plants or have a bad odor so it would have to go
through a filter. But there is an exception. Bleach are from washing machines and in small amounts are healthy for plants.
It also mixes with water in the filter. The filter that is recommended is a settlement tank. Basically, it  lets substances
heavier or denser than water sink and substances lighter or less dense than water float. So water is in the middle and 
 can be sent to plants with a pipe.</p>

<img src="Drip-Irrigation.jpg" alt="A drip irrigation system" width="400" height="300">

<p> The water coming out of the filter contains little bleach since most of it is used in the washing machine and water.
The irrigation system that is most efficient in water conserving is drip irrigation. It is supposed to send water directly
to the roots of the plants instead of seeping to the ground. Sprinklers seem convinient, but are inefficient. When water 
comes out it could miss the soil or sometimes does not seep through it. This lets the water evaporate. Actually 80% of the 
water does this! It is too wasteful which is why drip irrigation is better. </p>

<H2>Bleach for Plants</H2>
<p>An experiment to test bleach effect on plants is to have 4 plants and put different amounts of bleach in water for 3
of the plants and the last one gets clear water. Water the plants everyday. Even though most people would think plants will
get plants killed, that is because it is too much. A reasonable amount to test is one drop of bleach, 1 ml, and 2 ml.
Results are shown below (note that the plants in the chart only got watered some days and weekends):</p>

<p>You can see that the plant with regular water is the least healthiest and the plant with 1 drop of bleach is the most
healthiest. This proves that bleach in small amounts is good for plants. Also, notice that plant 2 - plant 4 have bleach and 
throughout the chart they often have dark green leaves while plant 1 (has regular water) had light green leaves. Dark
green leaves means more chlorophyll which is more healthy, but light green leaves means it lacks chlorophyll making it 
unhealthy.</p>

<H2>Advantages and Disadvantages</H2>
<ul>
<li>In a settlement tank the sludge (things that sink in the tank) and materials less dense than water have to be cleaned <strong>daily</strong>
<li>When using drip irrigation the pipes need to be cleaned, somewhat, weekly and most likely not efficient for watering lawns
<li>If sent to toilet water it would have to be used daily ottherwise the water wil start to smell
<li>As you may know toilets use a lot of water so, it could save water 
<li>Settlement tanks clean most dangerous substances to plants to insure clean water for them
<li>Drip irrigation is water efficient, is easy to be installed, and has no drift (drift is water that is wasted when it  like being poured into the sidewalk) 
</ul>

<H2>Conclusion</H2>
<p>Although, the system requires high maintence it would help reduce the water wasted on irrigation and toilets. Water is
limited and we have to conserve it making the system worth it. In the end, water is the most important thing we need to
take care of.</p>
